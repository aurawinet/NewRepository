Project Background / Client requirements
As a user my client wants to:
create a product, courier, or order dictionary and add it to a list
view all products, couriers, or orders
update the status of an order
persist my data
STRETCH update or delete a product, order, or courier
BONUS list orders by status or courier

How did you meet the client brief? (UNDERSTANDING CLIENT SPECIFICATION/REQUIREMENTS)
I have created product and order menus that aree working well. Currently finishing courier menu.

How did you guarantee the client requirements? (TESTING)
I tested my codes if they can run properly, and fixed errors.
I would do a unit tests.

If you had more time, what is one thing you would improve upon? (ACTION PLAN FOR FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION)
I would put text on the code in a more tasteful, more readable way.
